### A Custom UI (Or Two) For My Computer

## About Project

This repository contains the source code for some custom electron windows showcasing system stats on my computer. I have wired two displays up through motherboard power and run them off of the main graphics card. They are then mounted to my case. Reach out to me for more details on how you can set this up for your project.
